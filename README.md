# SystemsProject

Building my first website using fundamentals of network programming in C extending the CMU TINY web server. 

Main files are the netp/tiny/cgi-bin/megillah.c which is the cgi executable program, as well as netp/tiny/home.html which is the home page. 

With thanks to the existing CMU code, the open-source JSMN JSON parser module, and W3 Schools HTML.
